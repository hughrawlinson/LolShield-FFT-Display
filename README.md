# LolShield FFT Display

I'm writing code to display an fft analysis of audio on an arduino LolShield. It's currently a work in progress, and kind of works, except that the serial communication seems to be interfering with the leds.

## Using

I'm using Processing, Minim, Arduino Code, and the LedSign library, as well as [Jimmie Rogers' LolShield](http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/lolshield/) which I soldered together from a kit :D
